# HemaLink | Your blood. Their hope.

HemaLink is a web and mobile app that makes it easy to find nearby blood donation campaigns and book extraction appointments fast. It's designed to help donors connect with clinics in just a few taps. This platform serves as the final project for our last semester.

Both the frontend and backend are being developed simultaneously, with the frontend built using React, Vite, and Bootstrap, and the backend powered by a scalable .NET API architecture made in C# to support dynamic campaign listings and role-based access.
